    <h2>Chess - The board game</h2>
    <div class="container1" display="inline">
        <p class="intro">Chess is a board game played between two players, called white and black
            each controlling an army of chees pieces, with the objective of checkmating the opponent's king.
        </p>

            <p>It is played on a square board, made of 64 similar squares, with eight squares in each row and column.
                each player starts with 16 pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen, and one king
            </p>
            <p>Chess is a turn-based strategy game with no hidden information, and the element of luck is virtually non-existent in the game.
                Chess has existed in different forms for over a thousand years, with the game developing over that time into the gameplay and rules that are used today. In competitive chess, a clock is utilized to prevent games from going on for long periods of time.

    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for castling, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. 
        With the sole exception of en passant, all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies. Moving is compulsory; a player may not skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental.
    </p>
    <p>Each piece has its own way of moving:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The king moves one square in any direction. There is also a special move called castling that involves moving the king and a rook. 
            The king is the most valuable pieceâ€”attacks on the king must be immediately countered, and if this is impossible, the game is immediately lost 
        </li>
        <li>A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.</li>
        <li>A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
        <li>A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
        <li>A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.</li>
        <li>A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram). A pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square (black crosses). 
            It cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file. A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.
        </li>
    </ul>
